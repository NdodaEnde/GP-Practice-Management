## 🚧 IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED

### Document Digitization with LandingAI
**Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - API Balance Issue

**Issue**: LandingAI API returns 402 "Payment Required" error
```
Error code: 402 - {'error': 'Payment Required. User balance is insufficient.'}
```

**Impact**:
- Cannot process new documents
- Cannot test end-to-end validation workflow with real data
- Existing features (validation interface) work, but need processed documents to test

**Workaround Options**:
1. Top up LandingAI API balance
2. Use mock data for testing
3. Focus on other features that don't require document processing

---

## 📊 TESTING STATUS

### Backend Testing
- ✅ Patient endpoints: Working
- ✅ Encounter endpoints: Working
- ✅ Invoice endpoints: Working
- ✅ Analytics endpoints: Working
- ✅ GP validation save endpoint: **13 scenarios tested, all passed**
- ⏸️ GP upload endpoint: Blocked by LandingAI API balance

### Frontend Testing
- ✅ Dashboard loads correctly
- ✅ Navigation working
- ✅ Patient registry working
- ✅ Analytics page rendering with real data
- ⏸️ GP digitization workflow: Needs LandingAI balance to test fully
- ⏸️ Validation interface editing: Need processed document to test
