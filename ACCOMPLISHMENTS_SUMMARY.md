## 🚧 IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED

### Document Digitization with LandingAI
**Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - API Balance Issue

**Issue**: LandingAI API returns 402 "Payment Required" error
```
Error code: 402 - {'error': 'Payment Required. User balance is insufficient.'}
```

**Impact**:
- Cannot process new documents
- Cannot test end-to-end validation workflow with real data
- Existing features (validation interface) work, but need processed documents to test

**Workaround Options**:
1. Top up LandingAI API balance
2. Use mock data for testing
3. Focus on other features that don't require document processing

---

## 📊 TESTING STATUS

### Backend Testing
- ✅ Patient endpoints: Working
- ✅ Encounter endpoints: Working
- ✅ Invoice endpoints: Working
- ✅ Analytics endpoints: Working
- ✅ GP validation save endpoint: **13 scenarios tested, all passed**
- ⏸️ GP upload endpoint: Blocked by LandingAI API balance

### Frontend Testing
- ✅ Dashboard loads correctly
- ✅ Navigation working
- ✅ Patient registry working
- ✅ Analytics page rendering with real data
- ⏸️ GP digitization workflow: Needs LandingAI balance to test fully
- ⏸️ Validation interface editing: Need processed document to test

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - CURRENT PRIORITY

### Phase 1.6: Document-to-EHR Integration (5 days) ⭐

Since LandingAI document processing is currently blocked, we're focusing on completing the digitization workflow loop.

#### 1. Smart Patient Matching (1 day)
**Approach:** Semi-automatic with human confirmation
- Automatic search by SA ID number (primary method)
- Fallback: Name + DOB fuzzy matching
- Confidence scoring: High (95%+), Medium (70-94%), Low (<70%)
- User confirmation interface with side-by-side comparison
- Duplicate prevention
- "Create New Patient" option

**Why This Approach:**
- Prevents duplicate patient records
- Catches name variations (maiden names, spelling differences)
- Human oversight for edge cases
- Fast for obvious matches (one click)
- Safe for uncertain cases

---

#### 2. Automatic EHR Population (1.5 days)
**After user confirms patient match:**
- Create new patient if no match
- Create encounter from validated document data
- Populate vitals, chronic conditions, medications, clinical notes
- Smart merging (avoid duplicate conditions/medications)
- Link original document to encounter
- Update document status to "linked"
- Audit logging

**Benefits:**
- Validated data automatically flows into EHR
- Historical records properly captured
- Complete patient timeline maintained

---

#### 3. Document Archive Viewer (2 days) - **CRITICAL FOR COMPLIANCE**
**South Africa Requirement: 40-year retention for medical records**

**Features:**
- Patient document history timeline
- View original PDF (immutable)
- View extracted/validated data side-by-side
- Validation audit trail (who, when, what changed)
- Access control (all staff for now, role-based later)
- Print/download for legal cases
- Legal export package (document + audit trail)

**Document Types Supported:**
- Consultation notes
- Lab results
- Prescription history
- Hospital discharge summaries
- All scanned medical documents

**Legal/Compliance:**
- Access audit logs (who viewed what and when)
- Document integrity verification (cryptographic hash)
- Chain of custody tracking
- Export for HPCSA audits and legal proceedings
- POPIA compliance (Protection of Personal Information Act)

---

#### 4. Access Audit Trail (0.5 days)
- Log every document access (view, download, print, export)
- Track user, timestamp, IP address, action
- Searchable audit logs
- Alert on suspicious patterns
- Immutable logs for compliance

---

### Implementation Order:
1. ✅ Day 1: Smart patient matching
2. ✅ Day 2-3: EHR population workflow
3. ✅ Day 4-5: Document archive viewer
4. ✅ Day 5: Access audit trail

**After Phase 1.6 Complete:**
- Digitization workflow will be fully functional end-to-end
- Historical patient records properly archived
- Legal compliance requirements met
- Ready to move to Queue Management (Phase 2)
