The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned from implementing a comprehensive Phase 3 Billing system with PayFast integration to a strategic focus on enhancing the core Digitization Module. The trajectory details the iterative development of a client-agnostic, template-driven document extraction system (Phase 1). This involved creating a flexible field mapping system with dedicated backend APIs, database migrations, and a frontend configuration UI. Subsequent work extended this to an Enhanced Extraction System that dynamically applies these templates, integrates ICD-10 and NAPPI lookups, and supports batch uploads. The process included debugging frontend display issues, addressing critical user feedback on page consolidation for production, and creating dedicated documentation for each phase. The current work is focused on resolving a frontend JSX syntax error in the newly merged  page.

<product_requirements>
SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP practices, providing Patient & Encounter Management and Document Digitization. It uses LandingAI for document extraction, storing raw documents in MongoDB and structured data in Supabase. The primary goal is to offer a comprehensive EHR system that is efficiently populated, managed, and billed.

Key features include:
1.  **Patient Safety**: Allergies, structured Diagnoses (ICD-10), Vitals, with an emphasis on auto-populating from digitized documents.
2.  **Clinical Workflow (Phase 2)**: NAPPI codes for medications, Structured Clinical Notes (SOAP), Lab Orders & Results, Procedures, and Immunizations tracking.
3.  **Billing System (Phase 3)**: Robust system for South African practices, including invoice generation (NAPPI/ICD-10), payment recording (split payments, receipts), basic financial reporting, claims management (ICD-10/NAPPI codes, export), claim status tracking, and PayFast payment gateway integration.
4.  **Digitization Module Improvement**: This is the current focus, aiming for a client-agnostic system to capture diverse medical records (immunizations, lab results) from digitized documents and allocate them to structured tables without custom coding per client. It also includes batch uploading capabilities. The implementation so far includes a template-driven extraction system for flexible field mapping, an enhanced extraction engine, batch upload functionality, and a validation queue.

1.  Creating the new  component to replace  and .
2.  Updating  and  to route to  and comment out the old upload page links.
3.  Ensuring the  toggle functionality, previously only in single-file mode, is now applicable to both single and batch upload modes within the new  component.

The current work is paused due to a  in  at line 594:12, as reported by the compiler in Chat Message 335. This indicates a structural issue in the JSX within the newly merged component.
