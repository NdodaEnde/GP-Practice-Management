The previous AI engineer focused on building and refining the SurgiScan GP workflow. Initial work involved setting up the backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, Supabase) and frontend (React, Shadcn, Tailwind), implementing core features like patient/encounter management, and a mock document digitization flow. A significant effort was made to integrate a comprehensive 6-tab EHR system and enhance the Analytics page, including debugging  schema issues. The trajectory then detailed the integration of a separate LandingAI-based document processing microservice. This involved setting up the microservice (FastAPI, Flask for some parts), resolving numerous dependency, import, and configuration issues, and finally getting it to run on port 5001 with a backend proxy. The subsequent phase focused on the frontend GP Patient Digitization and Validation Interface. This included creating new frontend components, implementing file upload, handling API errors (404s, 500s, timeouts), and crucially, enabling visual grounding for the PDF and extracted markdown. Key challenges involved fixing PDF worker loading (CORS), enabling bi-directional highlighting and scrolling between the PDF and markdown, and implementing continuous PDF scrolling with a resizable panel. The current work is focused on making the extracted data tabs editable for human validation.

<product_requirements>
SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS platform for Occupational Health and GP Practices, emphasizing data isolation and a hybrid Supabase/MongoDB architecture. The current focus is the GP Practice workflow MVP.
Key features already implemented:
1.  **Patient & Encounter Management:** CRUD for patients and encounters.
2.  **Document Digitization:** Processes records, stores scanned documents, parses using LandingAI (now integrated via microservice), and allows validation/editing. Patient matching occurs post-validation.
3.  **Validation Interface:** Side-by-side view of original PDF and parsed JSON data (now markdown), with sections for demographics, medical history, medications, allergies, lab results, clinical notes. Includes validation notes and an Approve Document button. This now features bi-directional grounding (hover/click on PDF or markdown highlights and scrolls to corresponding sections), continuous PDF scrolling, and a resizable panel.
4.  **Billing:** Creation of invoices linked to encounters.
5.  **EHR/EMR System:** Comprehensive 6-tab interface replacing basic patient details.
6.  **Analytics Page:** Dashboard displaying operational, clinical, and financial statistics, enhanced with live data.
Future roadmap includes: AI Scribe, Android tablet self-registration, pre-booking system, and intelligent semantic search with visual grounding.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved significantly enhancing the GP Patient Digitization and Validation Interface. The AI engineer debugged and resolved issues related to the PDF viewer, including a loading PDF spinning wheel caused by a 404/CORS error for  (fixed by locally hosting the worker script in ). The PDF display was upgraded to allow continuous vertical scrolling through all pages and a draggable divider was added for responsive panel resizing.

Furthermore, a critical feature of bi-directional visual grounding was implemented in . This allows users to hover or click on a parsed markdown chunk in the right panel, which then highlights the corresponding area in the original PDF on the left and automatically scrolls the PDF to that section. Conversely, hovering or clicking on a region in the PDF now highlights and scrolls to the corresponding markdown chunk. The markdown itself is now correctly rendered, addressing an issue where raw HTML tags were displayed.

Backend and frontend timeouts for document processing were increased to 180 seconds to accommodate the microservice's processing time. Minor UI fixes and error handling improvements were also made.

The current state is that the  successfully displays the original PDF, renders the extracted data as markdown, and provides interactive bi-directional grounding between the two views with a flexible layout. The immediate next step is to make the individual data tabs (Demographics, Chronic Care, Vitals, Clinical Notes) within this interface editable, as explicitly requested by the user, to enable human validation.
