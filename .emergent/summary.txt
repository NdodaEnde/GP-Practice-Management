The AI engineer's work spanned multiple critical areas: debugging UI/UX, refining core patient workflows, fixing data persistence issues, and initiating a major architectural refactor for document processing. Initially, a subtle UX bug in the Reception Check-In search was resolved by adding a  flag, preventing premature No patients found messages. Subsequently, the new patient registration workflow was streamlined, moving from a fragile state-based dialog to a robust URL-based redirect for immediate check-in. This required significant debugging of React state, router paths, and  hooks.

A major focus then shifted to the Document Digitization and Patient EHR integration. This involved fixing patient demographics not being saved, raw JSON displaying in the EHR, and mock data overriding real patient conditions and medications. The engineer refactored backend endpoints () to correctly parse and save clinical data into structured Supabase tables (conditions) and MongoDB (medications), and updated frontend components (, ) to fetch and display this real data, including medication parsing and grouping.

Finally, a critical architectural refactor was initiated for document processing. The system moved from a synchronous parse-and-extract model prone to timeouts to an asynchronous Parse → Store → Extract workflow. This involved creating a new  page, integrating Supabase Storage for PDF files, and MongoDB for parsed JSON data. Backend endpoints were updated to manage document lifecycle and status. The most recent work focused on debugging persistent 500 errors when retrieving parsed data and PDF documents, eventually resolving duplicate backend endpoints and ensuring correct data flow from Supabase Storage and MongoDB to the frontend.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, requiring strict data isolation. The MVP encompasses Patient & Encounter Management, Document Digitization via a LandingAI microservice, and a Validation Interface for extracted data (Demographics, Chronic Care, Vitals, Clinical Notes) with bi-directional grounding. Raw documents are stored in MongoDB, while validated structured data is moved to Supabase upon approval. Key existing features include Patient Matching, automatic EHR population, a Document Archive Viewer, Access Audit Trail, a Queue Management System (Reception Check-in, Queue Display, Workstation Dashboard), and Vitals Station.

The recent development focused on enhancing the Consultation phase to reduce administrative overhead:
1.  **AI Scribe Feature**: Real-time voice transcription and AI-driven SOAP note generation (using OpenAI Whisper and GPT-4o) was completed and integrated.
2.  **Enhanced Prescription Module (Phase 4.2)**: This included new database schemas, backend endpoints, and frontend components for prescriptions, sick notes, and referrals. A key feature was auto-extracting data from SOAP notes to pre-fill these forms, streamlining doctor tasks.
3.  **Comprehensive EHR Integration**: Linking AI Scribe consultations to patient records, creating encounters, logging diagnoses, and associating prescriptions.
4.  **Bug Fixes**: Addressing issues like AI Scribe API key authentication, Document-to-EHR data mapping (chronic care, vitals from LandingAI), a PDF bidirectional scrolling bug, and a non-functional patient search in the Queue Management system's Reception Check-in.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing **Phase 1.7 - Document Architecture Refactor**, focusing on the **Digitised Documents page** and a more robust document processing workflow (Parse → Store → Extract).

The current state is as follows:
1.  **Digitised Documents Page ()**: The page is successfully rendering with search, status, and date range filters.
2.  **Document Upload Flow**:
    *   PDF files are now uploaded and stored in **Supabase Storage** (in a  bucket).
    *   The raw JSON parsed data from the microservice is stored in **MongoDB** (in a  collection).
    *   Metadata about the document (including references to its storage locations) is recorded in a new  table in **Supabase**.
    *   The  table schema has been finalized in Supabase.
3.  **Document Validation Flow**:
    *   A new route  and  component have been created.
    *   This interface successfully loads and displays the original PDF from Supabase Storage and the parsed data from MongoDB.
    *   **The specific bug being resolved immediately prior**: The system was encountering  when trying to retrieve parsed document data. This was traced to a **duplicate backend endpoint** in  for . The old endpoint, which proxied to the external microservice, was being hit instead of the newly created endpoint that fetched from our internal MongoDB. The AI engineer successfully commented out the old proxy endpoint (line 1943 in ).

The user has just confirmed that the GP Patient Data Validation on Digitised Documents works well. it shows the pdf and the parsed/extracted data tabs. This signifies that the core document archiving, retrieval, and validation display for parsed documents is now functional, leveraging Supabase Storage for PDFs and MongoDB for parsed data. The next task is to enhance the workflow with an Extract button and refine the approval process.

Implement the Extract button feature in the Document Validation interface and refine the document approval workflow.
