The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two key areas. First, it completed the implementation of critical patient safety features, specifically establishing a comprehensive ICD-10 code system. This involved setting up backend APIs for search and AI-powered suggestions, creating a dedicated frontend test page (), and integrating it into the main application. Second, and more significantly, the engineer automated the EHR population workflow. This entailed developing helper functions and integrating them into  in  to automatically parse extracted document data and populate structured ,  (with ICD-10), and  tables. Additionally, allergy checks were integrated into the prescription workflow, and frontend components for diagnoses and vitals management were created and incorporated into . The work concluded with an agreement to proceed to Phase 2 and the initial step of processing NAPPI codes.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, focusing on Patient & Encounter Management and Document Digitization. It uses a LandingAI microservice for extraction, storing raw documents in MongoDB and structured data in Supabase. Key features include Patient Matching, EHR population, Document Archive Viewer, Queue Management, and AI Scribe for SOAP notes. Recent development focused on AI Scribe, an Enhanced Prescription Module, Comprehensive EHR Integration, various Bug Fixes, a Document Architecture Refactor (Parse → Store → Extract), EHR Enhancements (improved display, date grouping, diagnosis extraction), and Core EHR Component Expansion. The expansion included patient safety features like an Allergies system, a structured Diagnoses table with ICD-10 codes, and a dedicated Vitals table, with a major focus on auto-populating these from digitized documents.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing Phase 1: Patient Safety Critical. This included backend and frontend allergy systems and the initial creation of an ICD-10 test page.

During this trajectory, the following was completed:
1.  **ICD-10 Test Page (Frontend)**: The  was thoroughly reviewed and confirmed to be working. Its route was added to , and a navigation link was included in . Extensive UI testing confirmed keyword search and AI-powered suggestions (using GPT-4o) were fully functional and displayed results correctly.
2.  **Allergy Checks in Prescription Workflow**: The  component was enhanced to fetch and display patient allergies. It now warns users of potential medication conflicts with known allergies before a prescription is saved.
3.  **Diagnoses and Vitals Management**:
    *   **Backend APIs**: New FastAPI routers ( and ) were created in  and  respectively, and integrated into .
    *   **Frontend Components**: New React components  and  were created.
    *   **EHR Integration**: These new components were integrated into , with  placed in the overview tab and  within the existing vitals tab.
4.  **Automated EHR Population from Documents**: A major enhancement was implemented in . Helper functions (, , ) were added and called within . This allows the system to automatically parse extracted data from digitized documents and populate the structured ,  (with ICD-10 codes), and  tables in the EHR.
5.  **Roadmap Update**: Confirmed that AI-powered features (AI Scribe and ICD-10 suggestions) use the same GPT-4o model. A  file was created to reflect the updated project status.
