The AI engineer successfully built the SurgiScan GP workflow MVP. Initial work focused on setting up the FastAPI backend and React frontend, including basic CRUD operations for patients and encounters, and a mock digitization flow. A key challenge was Supabase table initialization, which was initially manual. The UI was developed using Shadcn components and Tailwind CSS, featuring Dashboard, Patient Registry, Patient Details (later EHR), New Encounter, Validation Interface, and Billing pages. A crucial fix involved reordering the document digitization workflow to validate parsed data *before* patient matching, preventing duplicates. The project then progressed to integrating a comprehensive EHR system with multiple tabs and an Analytics page. The final phase involved enhancing the Analytics page with real operational, clinical, and financial data, which required backend endpoint modifications and a fix for a missing  in the  table. The current state is the analytics dashboard with live data.

<product_requirements>
SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS platform targeting Occupational Health and GP Practices, emphasizing data isolation, hybrid database (Supabase/Postgres for relational, MongoDB for documents), and distinct workflows. The current focus is the **GP Practice workflow MVP**. Initial requirements included: mock digitization, skipping authentication for MVP, and using provided Supabase/MongoDB.
Key features developed:
1.  **Patient Management:** Registration, viewing patient details.
2.  **Encounter Management:** Creating new encounters.
3.  **Document Digitization:** Initially mocked, later enhanced to process historical and day-to-day records, store scanned documents for compliance, parse using LandingAI (mocked currently), and allow validation/editing of extracted data. Crucially, patient matching (new/existing) occurs *after* data validation to prevent duplicates.
4.  **Validation Interface:** Side-by-side view of original document and parsed JSON data, with sections for demographics, medical history, medications, allergies, lab results, and clinical notes. Includes validation notes and an Approve Document button.
5.  **Billing:** Creation of invoices linked to encounters.
6.  **EHR/EMR System:** A comprehensive 6-tab Electronic Health Record interface (Overview, Visits, Vitals & Labs, Medications, Investigations, Documents) for patients, accessible from the patient registry, replacing basic patient details.
7.  **Analytics Page:** Dashboard displaying operational, clinical, and financial statistics, including patient growth, encounters, revenue trends, top diagnoses, and various stats cards.
Future roadmap elements include: integration of a dedicated Python microservice for LandingAI, self-registration for patients via Android tablets, an AI Scribe for consultation notes (using OpenAI Whisper + GPT-4), and a pre-booking system.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and a hybrid database approach using Supabase (Postgres) for relational data and MongoDB for unstructured documents.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance:** Defines all backend API routes ( prefix), handles database interactions (MongoDB and Supabase), implements patient, encounter, document, and billing logic, and now includes enhanced analytics endpoints.
    -   **Changes:** Initial setup for patient/encounter/document/billing CRUD. Updated to include Supabase / for all models. Enhanced document upload logic for pre-validation patient matching. Added analytics endpoints (, , , ). Fixed a bug where  financial analytics endpoint assumed  column which was missing.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Environment variables for backend.
    -   **Importance:** Stores , , , . Critical for secure configuration.
    -   **Changes:** Populated with actual Supabase credentials.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
    -   **Importance:** Defines the main application layout and routing using .
    -   **Changes:** Added routes for , ,  (formerly ), , , , , and . Updated navigation to include new pages.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.js**: Entry point for the React app.
    -   **Importance:** Renders the root React component.
    -   **Changes:** Integrated the Shadcn  component for displaying notifications.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx**: Defines the overall layout including sidebar navigation.
    -   **Importance:** Provides consistent navigation and structure across the application.
    -   **Changes:** Added Digitize Documents and Analytics links to the sidebar navigation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**: Centralized API service for frontend-to-backend communication.
    -   **Importance:** Manages all API calls, ensuring the  is used with the  prefix.
    -   **Changes:** Added functions to call the new analytics endpoints.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/** (e.g., , , ): Individual page components.
    -   **Importance:** Implement specific UI and logic for each application feature.
    -   **Changes:**  was replaced by  to implement the comprehensive 6-tab EHR.  was created for the new workflow.  was created and subsequently enhanced with real data and ECharts visualizations.  was updated to include View EHR buttons.  was enhanced to clearly display the validation step before patient matching.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on enhancing the **Analytics page** and ensuring its functionality. The AI engineer updated the backend () to expose several new analytics endpoints for operational, clinical, and financial data. These endpoints calculate metrics such as patient growth, total encounters, revenue, and clinical summaries, leveraging both Supabase and MongoDB data.

On the frontend, the  file was updated to include functions for calling these new backend analytics endpoints. The  component was then modified to fetch data from these services and display it using ECharts visualizations, including patient growth trends, payer type breakdown, and revenue trends.

During this process, an error Failed to load analytics was encountered. Debugging the backend logs revealed that the  table in Supabase did not have a  column, which the financial analytics query was trying to access. The AI engineer successfully fixed this by modifying the backend logic in  to adapt to the existing Supabase schema, ensuring the financial analytics endpoint functions correctly without requiring a database schema change.

Following the fix, all analytics endpoints were individually tested via  and confirmed to be working. The immediate next step is to visually confirm the updated Analytics page in the browser.
