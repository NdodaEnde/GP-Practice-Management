<analysis>
The AI engineer's work evolved from initial bug fixes and minor UI enhancements to a significant architectural refactor of the document processing workflow and a foundational overhaul of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) schema. Key achievements include a robust Parse-Store-Extract document pipeline using Supabase Storage and MongoDB, dynamic display of extracted data, and enhanced patient EHR views with date grouping and compact timelines. A critical patient safety phase began, focusing on implementing a comprehensive allergies system with backend APIs and a frontend UI, and integrating ICD-10 codes for diagnoses. The process involved meticulous debugging, re-evaluating architectural decisions based on user feedback, and systematically building new features while ensuring backward compatibility with existing data entry methods.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, focusing on Patient & Encounter Management and Document Digitization. It uses a LandingAI microservice for extraction, storing raw documents in MongoDB and structured data in Supabase. Key features include Patient Matching, EHR population, Document Archive Viewer, Queue Management, and AI Scribe for SOAP notes.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **AI Scribe**: Real-time transcription and AI SOAP note generation.
2.  **Enhanced Prescription Module**: Database schemas, backend, and frontend for prescriptions, sick notes, and referrals, with auto-extraction from SOAP notes.
3.  **Comprehensive EHR Integration**: Linking AI Scribe consultations to patient records, creating encounters, logging diagnoses, and associating prescriptions.
4.  **Bug Fixes**: Addressing AI Scribe API auth, Document-to-EHR mapping, PDF bidirectional scrolling, and patient search in Reception Check-in.
5.  **Document Architecture Refactor (Phase 1.7)**: Implementing a Parse → Store → Extract workflow, including new  and  pages, Supabase Storage for PDFs, and MongoDB for parsed JSON.
6.  **EHR Enhancement**: Improving Patient EHR display (contact, address, medical aid, vitals), date grouping for timelines, and refining diagnosis extraction from SOAP notes.
7.  **Core EHR Component Expansion**: Implementing patient safety features like an **Allergies system**, a structured **Diagnoses table** with ICD-10 codes, and a dedicated **Vitals table**.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing **Phase 1: Patient Safety Critical** from the newly defined roadmap.

The specific tasks concluded were:
1.  **Backend Allergy System**: Database tables (, , , ) were defined and migrated in Supabase (with  and  types adjusted to  manually by the user due to initial UUID conflicts). ICD-10 codes were successfully loaded from an Excel file (41,008 codes). Backend API endpoints for managing allergies () and searching ICD-10 codes () were created and integrated into , and successfully tested.
2.  **Frontend Allergy Management**: A new React component  was created and integrated into . This component displays existing allergies or No known allergies, provides an Add Allergy form, and shows a prominent RED ALERT banner if allergies are present. Testing confirmed successful addition of an allergy and the alert banner displaying correctly in the EHR.

The work is currently focused on the **ICD-10 Code Lookup and AI-powered suggestions**. The backend APIs for this feature have been tested and are working correctly, returning search results and AI-generated suggestions. The immediate task is to create a frontend test page () to expose this functionality in the UI for user testing.
