The previous AI engineer successfully implemented several critical features. Work began by resolving display issues within the Immunizations module, ensuring accurate dose tracking and status updates. This was followed by a comprehensive integration of the NAPPI code system into prescription workflows, including backend model updates, database schema migration, and a new frontend builder. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on developing a full Phase 3 Billing system, encompassing invoice generation (with NAPPI/ICD-10), payment recording (including split payments and receipts), financial reporting, and claims management, culminating in a functional PayFast payment gateway integration. The PayFast integration involved multiple debugging steps to resolve signature and passphrase issues. The trajectory concludes with the user raising a strategic question about enhancing the digitization module to be client-agnostic and handle diverse medical record types, indicating a shift in focus towards improving core data extraction capabilities.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, designed for Patient & Encounter Management and Document Digitization. It uses a LandingAI microservice for document extraction, storing raw documents in MongoDB and structured data in Supabase. The core problem is to provide a comprehensive EHR system that can be efficiently populated, managed, and billed.

The application includes:
1.  **Patient Safety Features**: Allergies system, structured Diagnoses with ICD-10 codes, and a Vitals table, with a strong emphasis on auto-populating these from digitized documents.
2.  **Clinical Workflow Enhancements (Phase 2)**:
    *   NAPPI code system for South African medications (integrated into Prescription Module).
    *   Structured Clinical Notes (SOAP) for AI Scribe output.
    *   Lab Orders & Results.
    *   Procedures.
    *   Immunizations tracking.
3.  **Billing System (Phase 3)**: A robust billing system based on South African healthcare practices to handle the financial workflow.
    *   Invoice Generation: Auto-generate invoices from encounters with line items (consultation, medications with NAPPI, procedures, lab tests, immunizations), VAT calculation, and professional format.
    *   Payment Recording: Support various methods (Cash, Card, EFT, Medical Aid), split payments, payment status tracking, and receipt generation.
    *   Basic Financial Reporting: Daily/monthly revenue, outstanding payments, payment method breakdown.
    *   Claim Generation: Generate claims with ICD-10 diagnosis and NAPPI codes, procedure codes, and export to CSV/PDF.
    *   Claim Status Tracking: Workflow from submitted to paid/rejected, outstanding claims, rejection reasons.
    *   Integrate Payment Gateway (PayFast) for automated card processing.
    *   Potential future: Medical Aid Switch integration for electronic claims.
4.  **Digitization Module Improvement**: User explicitly requests a client-agnostic way of capturing diverse medical records (immunizations, lab results, etc.) from digitized documents, ensuring allocation to structured tables without custom development per client. Also, batch uploading.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully integrated the PayFast payment gateway into the SurgiScan application. This included:
1.  **Backend Implementation**: Installing the  library (for PDF generation, likely receipts), adding PayFast sandbox credentials (, , ) to , creating  for payment initiation and webhook (ITN) handling, and integrating this router into .
2.  **Frontend Implementation**: Creating , , . Routes for these pages were added to . The  was integrated into the  component, specifically within the payment recording section.
3.  **Debugging & Resolution**: The integration faced a persistent  error with the message signature: Generated signature does not match submitted signature. This was initially attempted to be fixed by checking URL encoding. The root cause was discovered to be an incorrect handling of the PayFast passphrase: the passphrase should *not* be URL encoded, and critically, if the user didn't set a passphrase in PayFast's sandbox account, then it should *not* be included in the signature generation at all. This was resolved by updating the signature generation logic in  to correctly handle the absence of a passphrase.

The PayFast payment processing was confirmed to be working successfully. The user then shifted focus, asking about the digitization module's ability to handle diverse medical records in an agnostic way and requesting a roadmap update for this.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update the roadmap to address the user's request for an agnostic and comprehensive digitization module capable of processing diverse medical record types.
