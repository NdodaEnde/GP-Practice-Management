The AI engineer's work spanned several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on enhancing the GP Validation Interface, making parsed data editable, and implementing bi-directional visual grounding for PDFs and markdown. This involved significant frontend development in  and , alongside creating a backend endpoint . After fixing frontend rendering issues and confirming backend functionality, a blocker emerged: the LandingAI API required payment, halting new document processing.

Consequently, the focus shifted to core application features. A revised roadmap prioritized Document-to-EHR Integration, including Patient Matching and a Document Archive Viewer, which were then successfully implemented with corresponding backend endpoints and frontend components. Following this, the Queue Management System and Workstation Dashboard were built, addressing patient check-in and queue display. The Vitals Station was then added to optimize nurse workflows. Most recently, the AI Scribe feature, leveraging Emergent LLM Key with OpenAI Whisper and GPT-5 for transcription and SOAP note generation, was implemented. Recent debugging efforts focused on resolving environment variable loading issues () and connection errors related to the Whisper API by explicitly setting the correct OpenAI base URL.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS platform for Occupational Health and GP Practices, emphasizing data isolation and a hybrid Supabase/MongoDB architecture, currently focusing on the GP Practice workflow MVP. Key implemented features include Patient & Encounter Management, a Document Digitization flow (now with a LandingAI-based microservice), a Validation Interface for extracted data (PDF + markdown with bi-directional grounding, continuous scrolling, resizable panels). Recent additions include editable tabs for Demographics, Chronic Care, Vitals, and Clinical Notes within the validation interface, with modification tracking. The Billing and comprehensive 6-tab EHR systems are also in place, alongside an enhanced Analytics Page.

Recent requests refined the data flow: raw documents go to MongoDB, extracted data to temporary state, and validated structured data to Supabase (Postgres) upon Approve Document. Crucially, subsequent work centered on Patient Matching (semi-automatic with human confirmation, ID-based), automatic EHR population (new encounters, updating patient records), a Document Archive Viewer (for compliance, timeline view, original PDF access), and Access Audit Trail (logging document views). A Queue Management System (Reception Check-in, Queue Display, Workstation Dashboard) and Vitals Station were then added, followed by an AI Scribe feature for real-time voice transcription and SOAP note generation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the **AI Scribe** feature, which is part of Phase 4 of the roadmap. This feature aims to provide real-time audio transcription and AI-generated SOAP notes from doctor consultations using **Emergent LLM Key** with OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-5 models.

The implementation involved:
1.  **Backend Integration**:
    *   Adding  to the  file.
    *   Installing  and usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]
              [-o ORGANIZATION] [-t {openai,azure}]
              [--api-version API_VERSION] [--azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT]

                        What API base url to use.
  -k API_KEY, --api-key API_KEY
                        What API key to use.
  -p PROXY [PROXY ...], --proxy PROXY [PROXY ...]
                        What proxy to use.
  -o ORGANIZATION, --organization ORGANIZATION
                        Which organization to run as (will use your default
                        organization if not specified)
  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.
                        'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning'
  --azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT
                        The Azure endpoint, e.g.
                        'https://endpoint.openai.azure.com'
  --azure-ad-token AZURE_AD_TOKEN
                        A token from Azure Active Directory,
                        https://www.microsoft.com/en-
                        us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-
                        id
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit libraries.
    *   Creating new FastAPI endpoints in :
        *    for audio transcription using Whisper.
        *    for generating SOAP notes using GPT-5.
2.  **Frontend Development**:
    *   Creating a new React page  for the consultation recording interface.
    *   Adding a route for this page:  in .
    *   Adding an AI Scribe button to the  page for easy access.

The initial attempt to use the AI Scribe resulted in a  error. This was debugged and fixed by correcting a newline issue in the  file where the  was concatenated with . After this fix, another error,  during transcription, occurred. This was identified as an issue with the Whisper API's base URL when used via . The AI engineer then explicitly modified  to use the standard OpenAI API endpoint () for the Whisper transcription. The backend was restarted, and the user was asked to retest.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the fix for the AI Scribe transcription connection error by re-testing the feature end-to-end.
