The AI engineer's work commenced with debugging the AI Scribe feature, specifically resolving API key authentication issues for Whisper transcription (shifting from Emergent LLM Key to a direct OpenAI key) and later for SOAP note generation. This led to a refactor where transcription used  and SOAP generation initially used , then switched to  directly after a  DNS issue. Next, the Enhanced Prescription Module (Phase 4.2) was built, encompassing database schema, backend endpoints, and frontend components for prescriptions, sick notes, and referrals, integrated into the AI Scribe page and Patient EHR. Crucially, the workflow was extended to auto-extract data from SOAP notes to pre-fill these forms, streamlining doctor's administrative tasks. A significant EHR integration then linked AI Scribe consultations to patient records, creating encounters, logging diagnoses, and associating prescriptions. Finally, the agent returned to Phase 1.6 (Document-to-EHR integration), fixing data mapping for chronic care and vitals from LandingAI extraction, and resolving a PDF bidirectional scrolling bug. The trajectory concluded with addressing a bug in the Queue Management system where the reception search was not functioning, despite the Vitals Station search working correctly.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, emphasizing data isolation with a hybrid Supabase/MongoDB architecture. The GP Practice workflow MVP includes Patient & Encounter Management, Document Digitization (LandingAI microservice), and a Validation Interface with editable tabs (Demographics, Chronic Care, Vitals, Clinical Notes) and bi-directional grounding. Recent refinements focused on storing raw documents in MongoDB and validated structured data in Supabase upon Approve Document. Key implemented features include Patient Matching, automatic EHR population, a Document Archive Viewer, Access Audit Trail, Queue Management System (Reception Check-in, Queue Display, Workstation Dashboard), and Vitals Station. Most recently, the AI Scribe feature (real-time voice transcription and SOAP note generation using OpenAI Whisper and GPT-4o) was completed and integrated. The current focus is on enhancing the Consultation phase to reduce administrative overhead for doctors by automating the extraction of clinical actions from SOAP notes to pre-fill prescription, sick note, and referral forms, and ensuring comprehensive EHR integration, and finally fixing existing bugs.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a critical issue in the **Reception Check-in** page. The user reported that the patient search functionality on  was not working for existing patients, while noting that the search on the  page worked perfectly.

The AI engineer's actions focused on:
1.  **Examining **: Reviewed the search implementation in  to understand its working logic ().
2.  **Examining **: Reviewed the search implementation in  to identify discrepancies or issues ().
3.  **Comparative Analysis**: Noted that The search implementation looks identical! Both use the same endpoint and logic. ().
4.  **UI Code Review**: Started to check the UI part of  to see how the search is triggered and results are displayed (, ).

The goal is to understand why the seemingly identical search logic is failing in  but working in  and then apply a fix. The work ended with the AI engineer attempting to find where the search is triggered in the  UI.
