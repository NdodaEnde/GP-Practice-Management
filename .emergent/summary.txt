The previous AI engineer significantly advanced the SurgiScan EHR application. Initial work centered on enhancing patient safety, including establishing a comprehensive ICD-10 system, integrating allergy checks into prescription workflows, and creating structured diagnoses and vitals management with automated EHR population from digitized documents. The most substantial recent effort involved implementing the NAPPI codes system, encompassing database schema, data extraction from a PDF (including iterative refinement for brand/generic name separation and dataset completeness), backend APIs, and a dedicated frontend test page. Subsequently, the engineer moved to Phase 2: Clinical Workflow Enhancement, completing Structured Clinical Notes (SOAP), Lab Orders & Results (with manual entry and EHR integration), Procedures, and Immunizations. Challenges included database migration issues (UUID vs. TEXT ID types), debugging frontend interaction for quick search buttons, and refining PDF data extraction. The work paused while fixing display inaccuracies in the Immunizations test page.

SurgiScan is a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS for Occupational Health and GP Practices, focusing on Patient & Encounter Management and Document Digitization. It uses a LandingAI microservice for extraction, storing raw documents in MongoDB and structured data in Supabase. Key features include Patient Matching, EHR population, Document Archive Viewer, Queue Management, and AI Scribe for SOAP notes. The application also provides an Enhanced Prescription Module, Comprehensive EHR Integration, and Core EHR Component Expansion. This expansion added patient safety features: an Allergies system, a structured Diagnoses table with ICD-10 codes, and a dedicated Vitals table, with a major focus on auto-populating these from digitized documents. Subsequent work introduced the NAPPI code system for medications, Structured Clinical Notes for AI Scribe output, Lab Orders & Results, Procedures, and Immunizations tracking to enhance clinical workflows.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was working on **Sprint 2.4: Immunizations**. The backend API and database schema for immunizations have been successfully implemented and tested. A frontend test page () was created to allow manual interaction with the system.

During user testing, it was identified that:
1.  The quick vaccine buttons on the  were not correctly resetting the  to 1. This was fixed by updating the  function to accept a query parameter and ensuring quick buttons utilize this override.
2.  The labels for Doses in Series and Which Dose? were initially confusing; these were improved with clearer text and an example section to guide the user.
3.  The user inquired about when to check Series Complete, which was clarified.
4.  Immediately before this summary request, two display-related bugs were reported on the :
    *   The summary card was showing a count of 1 record instead of the actual  value.
    *   The history display showed Dose 1/? instead of Dose 1/3.
The AI engineer was in the process of fixing these display issues in , having just noted that the output seems wrong and deciding to re-check file changes for proper display fixes.
