# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      AI Scribe Authentication Issue Fixed:
      
      Problem: User reported 401 error when transcribing audio. Whisper API was rejecting EMERGENT_LLM_KEY.
      
      Root Cause: EMERGENT_LLM_KEY only works for text LLM models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) via emergentintegrations library,
      NOT for OpenAI Whisper audio transcription API.
      
      Solution Implemented:
      1. Added OPENAI_API_KEY to /app/backend/.env with user-provided key
      2. Updated /api/ai-scribe/transcribe endpoint in server.py (lines 2378-2383) to use OPENAI_API_KEY
      3. SOAP generation endpoint continues using EMERGENT_LLM_KEY correctly (GPT-5 text model)
      4. Backend restarted successfully
      
      Ready for testing. Please test the AI Scribe workflow:
      1. Navigate to a patient's EHR
      2. Click "AI Scribe" button
      3. Record audio consultation
      4. Stop recording
      5. Verify transcription appears
      6. Click "Generate SOAP Notes"
      7. Verify SOAP notes are generated correctly
      
      Test Focus: Verify audio transcription now works with OpenAI API key authentication.

      AUTO-POPULATION WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
      
      PROBLEM SOLVED:
      Previously, extracted document data would only create encounters with bulk JSON data.
      The new structured tables (allergies, diagnoses, vitals) had to be manually populated.
      
      SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
      Enhanced create_encounter_from_document() with 3 new helper functions that automatically
      populate structured EHR tables from ANY document format:
      
      1. populate_allergies_from_document():
         - Extracts allergies from demographics section
         - Handles multiple formats: string, list, dict
         - Parses allergen, reaction, severity
         - Auto-creates allergy records in allergies table
         - Skips duplicates (checks existing allergies)
         - Handles "none", "nil", "NKA" cases
      
      2. populate_diagnoses_from_document():
         - Extracts diagnoses from chronic_conditions and clinical_notes
         - **AI-POWERED ICD-10 MATCHING**: Uses our /api/icd10/suggest endpoint
         - Falls back to keyword search if AI matching fails
         - Auto-creates diagnosis records with proper ICD-10 codes
         - Marks unmapped diagnoses for manual review
         - Skips duplicates
         - Links to encounter for context
      
      3. populate_vitals_from_document():
         - Extracts all vital signs from vitals section
         - Handles both old and new data structures
         - Creates individual vital records in vitals table
         - Auto-links to encounter
         - Uses document date as measurement date
         - Skips duplicates for same date
      
      WORKFLOW NOW:
      Upload Document → Parse → Extract → Validate → Confirm Match/Create Patient
      ↓
      ✅ Creates Encounter
      ✅ Auto-populates Allergies table (with RED ALERT in prescriptions)
      ✅ Auto-populates Diagnoses table (with AI-matched ICD-10 codes)
      ✅ Auto-populates Vitals table (individual structured records)
      ✅ Creates Conditions (legacy)
      ✅ Creates Medications
      
      INTELLIGENCE:
      - Regardless of doctor's document format
      - Regardless of how data is structured
      - System intelligently maps to correct EHR components
      - With proper medical coding (ICD-10)
      - With patient safety checks (allergy alerts)
      
      FILES MODIFIED:
      - /app/backend/server.py (added 3 helper functions + integration)
      
      TESTING NEEDED:
      Test with a real document that contains:
      1. Allergies (e.g., "Penicillin", "Aspirin")
      2. Diagnoses (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes", "Hypertension")
      3. Vitals (BP, HR, temp, etc.)
      
      Verify:
      - Allergy records created and show in AllergyManagement component
      - Diagnosis records created with ICD-10 codes and show in DiagnosesManagement
      - Vital records created and show in VitalsManagement
      - Prescription workflow shows allergy alerts

      IMMUNIZATIONS DISPLAY BUGS FIXED:
      
      ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
      1. History display showing "Dose 1/?" instead of "Dose 1/3"
      2. Summary card not displaying doses_in_series correctly
      
      ROOT CAUSE:
      The backend Immunization response model (Pydantic) was missing key fields that are stored in the database:
      - doses_in_series
      - route
      - anatomical_site
      - series_name
      - administered_by
      
      These fields were being saved to the database but not returned in API responses, 
      causing the frontend to display "?" and "Unknown" values.
      
      FIX IMPLEMENTED:
      Updated /app/backend/api/immunizations.py:
      - Enhanced Immunization response model (BaseModel) to include all missing fields
      - Added: doses_in_series, route, anatomical_site, series_name, administered_by
      - Now all fields stored in database are properly returned in API responses
      
      EXPECTED RESULTS:
      1. History display will now show "Dose 1/3" (or actual series total)
      2. Summary cards will show correct "Series total: 3" (or actual value)
      3. All immunization details (route, site, administrator) display correctly
      
      FILES MODIFIED:
      - /app/backend/api/immunizations.py (lines 62-77: Enhanced Immunization model)
      
      Backend restarted successfully and is running.
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      Test the ImmunizationsTestPage (/immunizations-test):
      1. Select a patient with existing immunizations
      2. Verify history shows "Dose 1/3" (not "Dose 1/?")
      3. Verify summary cards show correct "Series total" values

      IMMUNIZATIONS SUMMARY DISPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:
      
      USER FEEDBACK:
      1. Summary cards showing incorrect "Doses given" count (counting records instead of dose numbers)
      2. Requested conditional display: Show next due date if incomplete, else show "Complete"
      
      ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
      - Summary was counting number of immunization RECORDS (1 record = "Doses given: 1")
      - Should show HIGHEST dose_number (if you recorded dose 2, show "Doses given: 2")
      - Next due date and "Complete" status were both showing, needed conditional logic
      
      FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
      
      1. Backend Enhancement (/app/backend/api/immunizations.py, lines 217-258):
         - Added 'highest_dose_number' tracking to summary endpoint
         - Now tracks the maximum dose_number for each vaccine type
         - If user records dose 2 of 3, summary shows "Doses given: 2" not "1"
         - Conditional next_due_date: Only shown if series not complete
         - If series_complete=True, next_due_date is cleared (set to None)
      
      2. Frontend Enhancement (/app/frontend/src/pages/ImmunizationsTestPage.jsx, lines 180-202):
         - Changed display to use highest_dose_number instead of total_doses
         - Added conditional logic: Show "✓ Series Complete" OR "Next due: [date]", not both
         - If series complete: Show green checkmark message
         - If incomplete and has next_due_date: Show orange next due date
         - If incomplete and no next_due_date: Show nothing (clean UI)
      
      LOGIC FLOW:
      - User creates immunization with dose_number=2, doses_in_series=3
      - Summary now shows: "Doses given: 2" (not "1")
      - Series total: 3
      - Since dose 2/3, if next_dose_due is set: "Next due: [date]"
      - When user marks series_complete=True: Shows "✓ Series Complete" instead
      
      FILES MODIFIED:
      - /app/backend/api/immunizations.py (summary endpoint logic)
      - /app/frontend/src/pages/ImmunizationsTestPage.jsx (summary cards display)
      
      Backend restarted successfully.
      
      READY FOR USER VERIFICATION:
      Test at /immunizations-test:
      1. Verify "Doses given" shows dose number (2/3 = shows "2")
      2. Verify incomplete series shows next due date
      3. Verify complete series shows "✓ Series Complete" (no due date)
      4. Test with multiple vaccines at different completion stages
