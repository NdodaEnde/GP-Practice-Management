# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      AI Scribe Authentication Issue Fixed:
      
      Problem: User reported 401 error when transcribing audio. Whisper API was rejecting EMERGENT_LLM_KEY.
      
      Root Cause: EMERGENT_LLM_KEY only works for text LLM models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) via emergentintegrations library,
      NOT for OpenAI Whisper audio transcription API.
      
      Solution Implemented:
      1. Added OPENAI_API_KEY to /app/backend/.env with user-provided key
      2. Updated /api/ai-scribe/transcribe endpoint in server.py (lines 2378-2383) to use OPENAI_API_KEY
      3. SOAP generation endpoint continues using EMERGENT_LLM_KEY correctly (GPT-5 text model)
      4. Backend restarted successfully
      
      Ready for testing. Please test the AI Scribe workflow:
      1. Navigate to a patient's EHR
      2. Click "AI Scribe" button
      3. Record audio consultation
      4. Stop recording
      5. Verify transcription appears
      6. Click "Generate SOAP Notes"
      7. Verify SOAP notes are generated correctly
      
      Test Focus: Verify audio transcription now works with OpenAI API key authentication.

      AI SCRIBE BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED:
      
      ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Audio transcription endpoint (/api/ai-scribe/transcribe) is now working
      - Authentication fix successful: OPENAI_API_KEY now used instead of EMERGENT_LLM_KEY
      - Tested with WAV audio file, received 200 OK response with valid transcription
      - No 401 authentication errors in backend logs
      - Whisper API integration functioning correctly
      
      ✅ SOAP Generation endpoint (/api/ai-scribe/generate-soap) confirmed working
      - GPT-5 integration via EMERGENT_LLM_KEY functioning correctly
      - Generated professional SOAP notes with all 4 sections (S.O.A.P)
      - Tested with realistic medical consultation transcription
      - 800-character structured output with proper medical terminology
      
      🎯 STUCK TASK RESOLVED: "AI Scribe audio transcription endpoint" moved from stuck_tasks to working
      
      BACKEND TESTING STATUS: Both AI Scribe endpoints are fully functional
      NEXT: Frontend testing needed for complete end-to-end workflow validation

      AI SCRIBE UPDATED: Switched to OpenAI Direct API for Both Endpoints
      
      Per user request, both AI Scribe endpoints now use OpenAI API directly with OPENAI_API_KEY:
      
      1. /api/ai-scribe/transcribe:
         - Uses: OpenAI Whisper API (whisper-1 model)
         - Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions
         
      2. /api/ai-scribe/generate-soap:
         - UPDATED: Now uses OpenAI GPT-4o (was GPT-5 via Emergent)
         - Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
         - Successfully tested with sample transcription
         - Generates proper SOAP notes with all 4 sections
      
      No dependency on Emergent LLM Key anymore. All AI features use single OPENAI_API_KEY.
      Ready for comprehensive backend testing.
